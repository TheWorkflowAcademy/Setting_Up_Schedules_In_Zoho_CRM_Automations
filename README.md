# Setting_Up_Schedules_In_Zoho_CRM_Automations


## Use Case
There may be times where we need a function or action to run in Zoho CRM repeatedly at set intervals, such as updating the age for all Contacts on a weekly basis. Schedule in Automation in the CRM allows you this somethingsomething without having to edit a record to trigger a function.

## Set Up
Prior knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Deluge will be helpful. For this example, we will use the Accounts and Contacts modules, but any modules could be used. 
We will set up the following:

* A Zoho Creator form with:
  * a note field
  * an Account ID field
* User input workflow to initalize the table

You will need to have in place:

* CRM oauth connection in Creator
