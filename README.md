# Setting_Up_Schedules_In_Zoho_CRM_Automations


## Use Case
There may be times where we need a function or action to run in Zoho CRM repeatedly at set intervals, such as updating the age or an age group for all Contacts on a weekly basis. Setting up a schedule in automation allows you this capability without having to manually edit a record to trigger a function.

*Note you can use a previously written function or write a new one, but since these actions aren't tied to a specific record, no parameters are needed.


* A Zoho Creator form with:
  * a note field
  * an Account ID field
* User input workflow to initalize the table

You will need to have in place:

* CRM oauth connection in Creator
